## My Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me during Data Science/AI Bootcamp. Projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.




## Machine Learning Projects

- ### [The Effect of ALEKS (Math Software) on Mathematics Achivements on STAAR (Texas State Test)](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/ALEKS_STAAR.md)

  <p style="font-size:13px">In this project, I analyze our students' ALEKS Usage data and compare them with their STAAR Performance to find a correlation between
  them.</p>




## Deep Learning Projects

- ### [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/MNIST.md)
  
  <p style="font-size:13px">In this project, I develop a Feed Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification.</p>
  

## Probability, Statistics and Simulations

- [Secretary (Best Choice) Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Secretary_Best_Choice_Problem_Simulation.md)
- [Monty Hall Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Monty_Hall_Problem_Simulation.md)
- [Birthday Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Birthday_Problem.md)

## Academic Projects
