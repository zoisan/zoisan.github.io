## My Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me during Data Science/AI Bootcamp. Projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.


## Deep Learning Projects

- ### [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/MNIST.md)

  In this project, I develop a Feed Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks for MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification.



## Machine Learning Projects

- ### [Diamonds price prediction with Regression Models](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/Diamonds.md)

  In this project, I analyze diamonds dataset and build Machine Learning models to predict price values by their cut, color, clarity, dimensions and other attributes.



- ### [Diabetes disease progression prediction with Regression Models](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/Diabetes.md)

  In this project, I analyze diabetes dataset and build Machine Learning models to predict disease progression based on ten baseline variables of patients.


- ### [Titanic passenger survival prediction with Classification Models](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/Titanic.md)

  In this project, I analyze titanic dataset and build Machine Learning models to predict predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.



## Probability, Statistics and Simulations

- [Secretary (Best Choice) Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Secretary_Best_Choice_Problem_Simulation.md)
- [Monty Hall Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Monty_Hall_Problem_Simulation.md)
- [Birthday Problem Simulation](https://github.com/zoisan/zoisan.github.io/blob/master/prob_stat/Birthday_Problem.md)
